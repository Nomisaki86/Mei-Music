# Token Budget Defaults

- Be concise by default; expand only on request.
- Keep progress updates brief for simple tasks; use periodic updates for longer tasks.
- Prefer targeted searches/reads and avoid repeating the same lookups.
- Read focused file ranges first, then expand only if needed.
- Batch independent read/search steps when possible.
- Ask before expensive operations (full builds/tests, broad scans, network-heavy steps) unless the user requested them.
- For small, low-risk edits, skip full build/test by default and state what was not run.
- If scope is unclear, ask one focused question before broad exploration.
- If the user explicitly requests deep review/validation, prioritize completeness over token savings.
