# Token Budget Mode

## Communication
- Be concise by default; expand only when the user asks for detail.
- Keep intermediate updates short and infrequent for simple tasks.
- Keep final summaries brief: key result, changed files, blockers/next step.

## Tool-use efficiency
- Prefer targeted searches (`rg` with path/glob) over repository-wide scans.
- Avoid duplicate reads/calls when previous output is still sufficient.
- Read large files in focused ranges first; expand only when required.
- Batch independent read/search steps in parallel to reduce turn count.

## Expensive operations
- Ask before costly operations (full builds/tests, broad scans, network-heavy actions) unless explicitly requested.
- For small, low-risk edits, skip full build/test by default and note what was not run.
- For debugging, request minimal relevant log excerpts instead of full logs.

## Clarification policy
- If scope is unclear, ask one focused question before broad exploration.
- If the user asks for deep review/validation, prioritize completeness over token savings.
