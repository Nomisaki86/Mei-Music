# Agent Routing

- Before broad exploration, read `docs/agent-map.md` to identify likely ownership and entry points.
- Start with likely entry files first; use targeted searches instead of repository-wide scans.
- First pass default: about 6 files and 2-3 targeted searches, then reassess.
- If still unclear, ask one focused clarification question or expand incrementally when required.
- Avoid repeating identical reads/searches when recent output is still valid.
- For small edits in known files, skip routing exploration and implement directly.
- If routing/ownership changes because of your edits, update `docs/agent-map.md` in the same task.
- In the final response, include one line: `Agent map update: updated|not needed`.
